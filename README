########  Other Information  ########

To srape the data I have used an alternative link because the original site was forbidden. even though i've managed to get pass the forbidden, it wouldnt last long for much. so I used an alternative which is the same organization website for belgium. 

i did manage to scrape the state name, address and the price. in the price section there are some states which their price is undefined so I removed all the data which is undefined.
